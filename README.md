## Start

**Step 1: Test that Actions work**
```bash
# Make a small change to verify Actions are enabled
echo "Starting test" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "chore: verify actions are enabled"
git push origin main
```

Check the **Actions** tab - you should see the workflow run. If not, enable Actions (see top).

**Step 2: Begin the test**
```bash
mkdir answers
git add answers/
git commit -m "chore: create answers directory"
```

Then repeat the pattern 15 times.
